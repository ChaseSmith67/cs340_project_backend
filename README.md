# cs340_project_backend

Our project for CS340 Intro to Databases.

Chase Smith Brant Cass Winter 2023

This is the collection of materials used during the process of building our Film Finder database project for CS340. The project is intended to be a webapp with a backend built from the ground up using MySQL and a front-end using Node.js and React.

This repo will serve as a place to store all the related materials to the project during its creation in an effort to make collaboration easier.

CITATIONS: The Node.js starter app supplied by the professors for the course was used as a rough outline for some of the CRUD functionality of the webapp.
